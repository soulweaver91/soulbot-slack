Slack port of SoulBot
=====================

Quasi-private source code of a Slack bot called SoulBot, a port of a very old and crappy PHP based IRC bot with
the same name. Contributions by people uninvolved with the environment the bot is running in are most likely ignored.

See [the original repository](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot) for usage.
